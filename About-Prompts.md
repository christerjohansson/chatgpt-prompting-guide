### What is Prompt Engineering? 

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the initial text or input (the prompt) that is given to a language model like ChatGPT to generate a response. It involves designing prompts that guide the model to generate a specific tone, style, or type of content.

## Prompt Engineering: The Basics

- Use literal and explicit language
- Ask the model to act as if is an expert of the subject
- Ask the model to act as if it is a specific person, or combination of people 
- Ask the model to think 'step-by-step', especially in medium to complex tasks
- Experiment with outputs, `Give me 10 different examples`
- Refine the results, `Rewrite this to be more engaging, use clearer language, and use bullets to make it more readable.`

## When not to use Prompt Engineering or ChatGPT

- When you need 100% reliability
- When you have no way to evaluate the accuracy of the model's output
- When you need to generate content that is not in the model's training data

# Creating ChatGPT Prompts: A Framework

Using a prompt framework when creating prompts for ChatGPT. Frameworks provides structure and clarity to the prompt creation process. It breaks prompt creation process into clear and distinct steps. There is a framework called CRISPE (below ) for your use and experimentation of ChatGPT.

### CRISPE Prompt Framework:

- **Capacity and Role:** What role (or roles) should ChatGPT act as?  
- **Insight:** Provides the behind the scenes insight, background, and context to your request.
- **Statement:** What you are asking ChatGPT to do.
- **Personality:** The style, personality, or manner you want ChatGPT to respond in.
- **Experiment:** Asking ChatGPT to provide multiple examples to you.

## How to Build Prompts -> CRISPE Example

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Step
   </td>
   <td>Example Prompt
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Capacity and Role
   </td>
   <td>`Act as an expert on software development on the topic of machine learning frameworks, and an expert blog writer.`
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Insight
   </td>
   <td>`The audience for this blog is technical professionals who are interested in learning about the latest advancements in machine learning.`
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Statement
   </td>
   <td>`Provide a comprehensive overview of the most popular machine learning frameworks, including their strengths and weaknesses. Include real-life examples and case studies to illustrate how these frameworks have been successfully used in various industries.`
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Personality
   </td>
   <td>`When responding, use a mix of the writing styles of Andrej Karpathy, Francois Chollet, Jeremy Howard, and Yann LeCun.`
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Experiment
   </td>
   <td>`Give me multiple different examples.`
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The final prompt being:

```Act as an expert on software development on the topic of machine learning frameworks, and an expert blog writer. The audience for this blog is technical professionals who are interested in learning about the latest advancements in machine learning. Provide a comprehensive overview of the most popular machine learning frameworks, including their strengths and weaknesses. Include real-life examples and case studies to illustrate how these frameworks have been successfully used in various industries. When responding, use a mix of the writing styles of Andrej Karpathy, Francois Chollet, Jeremy Howard, and Yann LeCun.```

You could refine this by saying `Give me another example` or `Give me multiple examples` and other prompts below (under Prompt Refinement).

## Prompt Refinement: Fixing 'Soulless Writing'

- **Encourage creativity:** "Rewrite the existing document to make it more imaginative, engaging, and unique."`
- **Focus on storytelling:** `"Transform the existing document into a compelling story that highlights the challenges faced and the solutions provided."
- **Use persuasive language:** `"Refine the existing document by incorporating persuasive language and techniques to make it more convincing and impactful."
- **Emphasize emotion:** `"Add emotional language and sensory details to the existing document to make it more relatable and engaging."
- **Utilize sensory details:** `"Refine the existing document by adding sensory details and descriptive language to bring it to life and engage the reader."
- **Make the content concise:** `"Refine the existing document by removing unnecessary information and making it more concise and to-the-point."
- **Highlight key points:** `"Rewrite the existing document to emphasize the key points and make them more impactful."

- **Personalize the content:** "Refine the existing document by personalizing the language and making it more relatable to the reader."

## Prompt Refinement: Increase Readability

- **Use clear and concise language:** "Explain technical concepts in simple terms."
- **Add visual aids:** "Using mermaid.js you can include diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (low reliability)."
- **Use headings and subheadings:** "Divide the document into sections with clear headings and subheadings."
- **Highlight key points:** "Emphasize important information using bold or italic text."
- **Add real-life examples:** "Include case studies or real-world examples to make concepts more relatable."
- **Use clear and consistent formatting:** "Use a consistent font, font size, and layout throughout the document."
- **Include analogies and comparisons:** "Explain complex ideas using analogies or comparisons."
- **Use active voice:** "Write in active voice to make sentences more engaging and easier to follow."

## Prompts for Web Developers
